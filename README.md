## hei from merakeen 𖦹 we're in tallin

_merakeen studio_ is a European digital studio based in Tallin and working across full-stack web and mobile development, automation, AI-assisted tooling, creative engineering & more.  

Our GitHub organisation was made to host:

- Public code released from client work when open sourcing is agreed  
- Internal tools and utilities we consider useful for the wider community  
- Minimal, production-minded examples that reflect how we actually build  

## stuff you'll find here

- **open-source modules from EU-funded projects**  
  components from Erasmus+, youth, education or research projects that are safe to publish and client-approved

- **internal libraries and utilities**  
  tools, scripts, workflow automations and reusable components extracted from production systems

- **showcase repositories**  
  minimal examples aligned with our stack: astro, node, python, ci automation

- **experimental prototypes**  
  early-stage ideas released publicly to gather feedback

## more about how we work @ merakeen

- autonomy, trust and responsibility as defaults  
- honest communication without theatre or bureaucracy  
- respect for competence, time and attention  
- no ego-driven decisions, no micromanagement  
- outcomes over noise, clarity over unnecessary complexity  
- long-term thinking: sustainable builds instead of fragile quick fixes or obsolete  
- cultural awareness and respectful collaboration with partners across Europe  
- transparent processes: no hidden decisions, no gatekeeping  

## for developers & potential collaborators

Independent engineers, designers and various domain specialists partnering with merakeen can expect:

- clear scopes and realistic constraints  
- structured but lightweight workflows  
- autonomy in execution and direct, respectful communication  
- cross-disciplinary collaboration with designers, marketers and creatives  
- engineering, design and strategy decisions based on evidence, not ego  
- measurable impact across digital products, branding, content, advertising and creative work  
- a studio culture that values competence, clarity and long-term quality

## TL;DR ?

This organisation simply exists to share the parts of our work that can benefit others.
